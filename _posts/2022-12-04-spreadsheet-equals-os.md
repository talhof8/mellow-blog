At first glance, spreadsheets may seem like simple tools for organizing data.
But in reality, they can be incredibly versatile and useful for managing all aspects of your business.

One of the biggest advantages of using spreadsheets as an operating system is their versatility.
With a spreadsheet, you can track sales and expenses, create invoices, manage inventory, and even develop budgets 
and projections. In short, spreadsheets can be a one-stop shop for all of your business’s financial and operational 
information.

Because spreadsheets are so flexible and customizable, businesses can tailor them to fit their specific needs and
processes. This means that small businesses can create spreadsheets that are tailored to their business, and make them as simple 
or complex as they need to be.

In addition, spreadsheets are user-friendly and easy to use. This means that small businesses can easily train their
employees to use spreadsheets, and ensure that everyone is working with the same information and following the same
processes. This can help small businesses streamline their operations and improve their efficiency.

Another advantage of using spreadsheets as a back office is their accessibility. 
Because spreadsheets are digital, small businesses can access them from anywhere with an internet connection. 
This means that small businesses can work remotely, and share information with their team members and clients 
easily and securely.

One thing that can make using spreadsheets as an operating system challenging for small businesses is the amount of 
manual work involved. This is where [Mellow](https://www.playmellow.com) comes in.
