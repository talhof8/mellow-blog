Starting a new business is definitely exciting. It's a new beginning, a new chance. It's also pretty scary, especially 
if you bet your savings on it. Hiring employees, finding good suppliers, dealing with stupid bureaucracies, launching, 
marketing... It's a tough row to hoe.


Businesses that we've talked with kept complaining about how hard it is to find suppliers, about prices changing on a 
weekly basis, about how tedious it is to keep track of their inventory, about cash flow.


On the other hand, suppliers that we've talked with kept complaining about how frustrating it is to compete with Big 
Box suppliers, about how hard it is to find new clients and grow, about being paid late, on dealing with tire-kickers, 
struggling to offer Net Terms, having communication gaps with their buyers, managing trucking & freight, and so on...


There's a lot of frustration out there - on both sides - and barely enough efforts to provide solutions. 
[Mellow](https://www.playmellow.com/) is an effort to try and solve some of those issues. 
We're doing so by building a platform which lets businesses put their inventory stocking up for auction. 
Local distributors, wholesalers and suppliers are then able to bid for stocking inventories, 
in a closed bidding (i.e, suppliers cannot see others' bids).


When a bid goes through and the shipment is delivered, suppliers are able to offer buyers with gift cards and custom 
prices for the sake of building a long and lasting relationship.

Obviously auctions are not a new concept in the world of procurement. 
Mellow is merely taking them online, making it easier for suppliers to find more prospects and for small businesses to
avoid compromising on bad deals. We aspire to provide a level playing field for both suppliers and buyers, 
and help both sides establish healthy & mutually beneficial relationship.

Our ultimate goal is to become the go-to place for businesses and suppliers, and providing full-stack solutions for 
everything procurement-related. We're also working on supporting payments & providing Net Terms.
