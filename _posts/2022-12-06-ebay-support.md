Great news! We're excited to announce that [Mellow](https://www.playmellow.com) now supports eBay. 
This means that businesses using Mellow to manage their inventory can now sync their inventory and sales orders 
directly from Google Sheets to eBay.

With Mellow, managing your inventory has never been easier. Whether you're using a spreadsheet to keep track of your 
inventory or using a more advanced system, Mellow can help you automate the process of keeping your inventory 
up-to-date across all of your sales channels.

Now, with the addition of eBay support, businesses can easily connect their eBay account to Mellow and start syncing 
their inventory and sales orders. This means that you no longer have to manually update your inventory on eBay â€“ Mellow will take care of it for you.

Not only does this save you time, but it also helps to prevent mistakes and ensure that your inventory levels are 
always accurate. This is especially important for businesses that rely on eBay to sell their products, as having 
accurate inventory levels can help to prevent overselling and disappointed customers.

In addition to syncing inventory and sales orders, Mellow also provides valuable insights and analysis to help 
businesses make informed decisions about their inventory management. With Mellow, you can track your sales and 
inventory levels over time, identify slow-moving items, and make adjustments to your inventory levels to maximize 
sales and profits.

Overall, we're thrilled to add eBay support to [Mellow](https://www.playmellow.com) and we can't wait to see how 
it helps businesses streamline their inventory management process. If you're currently using Mellow to
